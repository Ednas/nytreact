# nytreact

This is a project from 2016 using React.js v.15.3.2
React has improved a lot since I did this project.

This has a custom configured webpack config. (This was built before create-react-app was a thing)
It uses Morgan for logging.
There are AJAX calls for scraping and it uses React router for routes.

I'm leaving this project pretty much as is. Enjoy.
